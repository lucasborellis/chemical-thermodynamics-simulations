# Chemical and Thermodynamics Simulation Library

This repository contains Python codes for chemical simulation problems and thermodynamic systems analysis, focusing on **phase equilibrium and vapor-liquid behavior**. It includes:

- **Raoult's Law**: Ideal solution behavior calculations.  
- **Modified Raoult's Law**: Phase equilibrium simulations with activity coefficients.  
- **Peng-Robinson EOS**: Equation of State calculations for compounds like ethyl acetate.  
- **Phi-Phi Approach**: Advanced fugacity-based calculations for vapor-liquid equilibrium.

These scripts and notebooks are intended as a **learning resource** and a **demonstration of thermodynamic modeling using Python**. Each module is self-contained and includes example calculations.
